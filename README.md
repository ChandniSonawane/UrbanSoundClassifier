Urban Sound Classification 
Dataset Name: UrbanSound8K Dataset Type of Data: Audio data
Size: The UrbanSound8K dataset consists of 8,732 labeled sound excerpts of urban sounds. The total size of the dataset is approximately 6 gigabytes (GB).
The dataset contains 8732 sound files of 10 different classes and is listed below. Our task is to extract different features from these files and classify the corresponding audio files into respective categories. It is available on Kaggle .
There is total 10 classes Air conditioner, Car Horn, Children Playing, Dog Bark, Drilling Machine, Engine Idling , Gun Shot , Jackhammer , Siren ,Street Music.

CONCLUSION : 
the development of an urban sound classification project offers numerous advantages in addressing noise pollution, environmental monitoring, public safety, urban planning, and smart city applications. By accurately categorizing and analyzing urban sounds, the project can contribute to creating more live able, sustainable, and resilient urban environments.
Through the utilization of deep learning techniques and systematic modeling of the system components and processes, the project aims to build a robust and accurate urban sound classification system. The proposed system involves key components such as input data, preprocessing, sequential model architecture, training, output classification, evaluation and fine-tuning, and deployment.
However, it is important to acknowledge the potential challenges associated with data variability, limited labeled data, model generalization, and computational requirements. Addressing these challenges requires further research and innovation in data collection and labeling, model training and optimization, and infrastructure development to support the computational demands of the project.
